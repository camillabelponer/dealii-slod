branch to have the LOD as a base class and elasticity and diffusion as derived


todo:
- make svd a function to make the code more readable
- how to avoid ( or speed up) the extraction for S_boundary ?
- move the parameter class into LODtools.h
- read val_min, val_max, eta from input file
- fix assemble coarse: doeas not need to be Q_iso_Q1 since we only use it as a comparison
