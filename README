implementation of SLOD for poisson problem and elasticity

to run the code an input file is needed: run the code once without argument to create an input file




  
    
todo:
- make svd a function to make the code more readable
- how to avoid ( or speed up) the extraction for S_boundary ?
- move the parameter class into LODtools.h
- read val_min, val_max, eta from input file
- fix assemble coarse: does not need to be Q_iso_Q1 since we only use it as a comparison
